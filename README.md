# mnist-dataset-in-tensorflow
This is a Tensorflow program that uses the mnist dataset of handwritten digits and is able to identity that digit. This model only uses that dataset and outputs its accuracy. It's meant as a way to play with neural networks and see how diffrent learning rates or amount of nodes effects the runtime but also the output accuracy 

# Requirements
Tensorflow
Keras
